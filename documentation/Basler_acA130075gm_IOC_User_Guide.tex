\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{} The Basler acA1300-75gm EPICS IOC is a software application for control and data acquisition of the acA1300-75gm camera through EPICS Process Variables (PVs). This IOC bundles, configures and simplifies the control of a range of \href{https://github.com/areaDetector/areaDetector}{areaDetector} modules and plugins, which were selected to provide features commonly required by the application, yet trying to keep the number of modules small. The IOC also makes use of an in-house areaDetector-based plugin module, \href{https://github.com/}{NDPluginDimFei}, which does gaussian fitting.

        \paragraph{} The figure \ref{fig:opi-general-controls} shows the 
                             \emph{General} group, which contain the main camera 
                             configuration. The parameters available in this group are: 

        \begin{enumerate}
                    \item \textbf{Enable}: Enables camera acquisition. The camera must be 
                        disabled in order for changes to the hard ROI (AOI) size to be 
                        accepted. Changes to the high level ROI (SoftROI) size can be done 
                        while the camera is enabled. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:enbl}{Enbl-Sel/Sts}.
            \item \textbf{Acquisition Mode}: Configures the trigger type for 
                        acquisition start. In automatic mode, frames are continuously 
                        acquired, without the need of external triggers. In triggered mode,
                        a frame is acquired for each external trigger received by the 
                        camera. The triggers are only effective as long as the time interval
                        between them is greater than the value set for the acquisition 
                        period. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:acq-mode}{AcqMode-Sel/Sts}.
            \item \textbf{Acquisition Period}: This parameter defines the smaller 
                        time interval, in seconds, between frame acquisitions. In automatic
                        acquisition mode, the period between acquisitions is equal to the
                        acquisition period. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:acq-period}{AcqPeriod-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Acquisition Period Limit}: This is a soft parameter used 
                        to set a warning associated to a given acquisition period. If the 
                        acquisition period is smaller than the acquisition period limit, 
                        than an alarm is raised for the acquisition period PV. Corresponding
                        PV: \hyperlink{pv:acq-period-lim}{AcqPeriodLowLim-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Exposure Mode}: Configures whether the exposure period 
                        should be timed by the camera or be equal to the external trigger 
                        signal width. For example, if the camera is configured to timed 
                        exposure mode and the exposure period is configured to 5000 
                        microseconds, then, when the camera starts the acquisition of a 
                        frame, e.g., in response to an external trigger, the camera CCD 
                        sensor is going to be exposed to light for 5000 microseconds. If the
                        camera is configured to width exposure mode, the camera CCD is 
                        exposed while the external trigger signal is high, i.e., the 
                        exposure period has the length of the external trigger. The width 
                        mode can only be used when triggered acquisition mode is selected. 
                        Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:exp-mode}{ExposureMode-Sel/Sts}.
            \item \textbf{Exposure Time}: Configures the exposure period, in 
                        microseconds. The configured period is only valid when the camera is
                        configured for timed exposure mode.
                        Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:exp-time}{ExposureTime-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Gain}: Configures the camera gain, in dB. Increasing gain 
                        increases camera sensitivity. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:gain}{Gain-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Auto Gain}: Command to auto adjust camera gain using the 
                        last acquired frame. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:auto-gain}{AutoGain-Cmd}.
            \item \textbf{Black Level}: Configures a lower intensity threshold for 
                        the camera. Increasing the black level reduces the range of 
                        intensities that the camera detects. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:black-level}{BlackLevel-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Debouncer Period}: Configures the external trigger 
                        debouncer period. An external trigger pulse must have at least the 
                        debouncer period duration in order to trigger the camera. Increasing
                        the debouncer period reduces the chance of noise triggering the 
                        camera. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:debouncer-period}{DebouncerPeriod-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Data Type}: Configures the image color depth to 8 bits or
                        12 bits. The data type of the image waveform is, in both cases, 
                        USHORT. When 8-bits is selected, each image pixel can range from 0 
                        to 255. When 12-bits is selected, each pixel can range from 0 to 
                        65535. Although all 16 bits are used to represent the pixel 
                        intensity in the second configuration, they are in fact scaled to 
                        cover the entire range, providing still the same resolution as 12 
                        bits would. \hyperlink{pv:data-type}{DataType-Sel/Sts}.
             \item \textbf{Transform}: Configures rotation or mirror operations to 
                        the image. The rotation can only be applied in steps of 90 degrees.
                        The transformed image is the one used by centroid and profile 
                        statistics. For instance, the centroid position calculated can be 
                        changed if the image is rotated. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:transf-type}{TransformType-Sel/Sts}.
            \item \textbf{Frame Count}: Read-only monitor displaying the number of 
                        frames acquired since IOC start. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:frame-cnt}{FrameCnt-Mon}.

    \subsection{Reset}\label{sec:reset}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Reset Command}: Resets the camera configuration and IOC 
                        driver. The connection is ended and automatically restablished. 
                        Correponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:reset}{Rst-Cmd}.

    \subsection{Error Monitoring}\label{sec:err-mon}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Last Error}: Read-only monitor of the last error detected
                        by the camera. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:last-err}{LastErr-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{Clear Last Error}: Write-only command that erases the last
                        error detected by the camera. Corresponding PV: 
                        \hyperlink{pv:clear-last-err}{ClearLastErr-Cmd}.
            \item \textbf{Connection Status}: TCP connection status. Corresponding 
                        PV: \hyperlink{pv:connection}{Connection-Mon}.

        \end{enumerate}

    %--- Section: Soft Region of Interest ---
    \subsection{Soft Region of Interest}\label{sec:soft-roi}

                The Soft ROI controls the output image size by discarding unnecessary data. It also decouples the image ROI from the rotation and mirror configurations, making it simpler for other plugins to account for ROI changes (see also \hyperref[sec:hard-roi]{Hard ROI}). It is NOT necessary to stop acquisition to make changes to Soft ROI configurations. Changes to the Soft ROI are also automatically accounted by \hyperref[sec:centroid-calc]{Centroid Calculation}.

        Soft ROI parameters:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Soft ROI Offset X}: Defines the ROI offset, in pixels, in the X axis, from left to right. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:soft-roi-off-x}{SoftROIOffsetX-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Soft ROI Offset Y}: Defines the ROI offset, in pixels, in the Y axis, from top to bottow. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:soft-roi-off-y}{SoftROIOffsetY-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Soft ROI Width}: Defines the ROI width, in pixels. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:soft-roi-width}{SoftROIWidth-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Soft ROI Height}: Defines the ROI height, in pixels. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:soft-roi-height}{SoftROIHeight-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Soft ROI Auto Center X}: When enabled, the X offset is automatically adjusted to centralize the ROI with respect to the camera whenever the ROI size is changed. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:soft-roi-auto-center-x}{SoftROIAutoCenterX-Sel/Sts}.
            \item \textbf{Soft ROI Auto Center Y}: When enabled, the Y offset is automatically adjusted to centralize the ROI with respect to the camera whenever the ROI size is changed. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:soft-roi-auto-center-y}{SoftROIAutoCenterY-Sel/Sts}.
        \end{enumerate}

    %--- Section: Hard Region of Interest ---
    \subsection{Hard Region of Interest}\label{sec:hard-roi}

        The Hard ROI (AOI) controls the size of the image which is sent by the camera to the IOC. This parameter is useful when trying to reduce the network bandwidth consumption, by sending a smaller region of interest. Changes to the Hard ROI require the \hyperref[sec:centroid-calc]{Centroid Calculation} to be recalibrated, in order to agree with the new ROI settings.

        Hard ROI parameters:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Hard ROI Offset X}: Defines the Hard ROI offset in the X axis, in pixels, from left to right. This configuration is not aware of rotation and mirror settings, which are applied by the IOC and not by the camera. Changing the X offset with the image rotated may change the output image Y axis instead, therefore the transformation setting (\emph{TransformType-Sts}) should be checked before making changes to the Hard ROI position. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:hard-roi-off-x}{AOIOffsetX-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Hard ROI Offset Y}: Defines the Hard ROI offset in the Y axis, in pixels, from top to bottow. This configuration is not aware of rotation and mirror settings, which are applied by the IOC and not by the camera. Changing the Y offset with the image rotated may change the output image X axis instead, therefore the transformation setting (\emph{TransformType-Sts}) should be checked before making changes to the Hard ROI position. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:hard-roi-off-y}{AOIOffsetY-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Hard ROI Width}: Defines the Hard ROI width. This configuration is not aware of the rotation setting, which is applied by the IOC and not by the camera. Changing the ROI width with the image rotated may change the output image height instead, therefore the transformation setting (\emph{TransformType-Sts}) should be checked before making changes to the Hard ROI size. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:hard-roi-width}{AOIWidth-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Hard ROI Height}: Defines the Hard ROI height. This configuration is not aware of the rotation setting, which is applied by the IOC and not by the camera. Changing the ROI height with the image rotated may change the output image width instead, therefore the transformation setting (\emph{TransformType-Sts}) should be checked before making changes to the Hard ROI size. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:hard-roi-height}{AOIHeight-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Hard ROI Auto Center X}: When auto center X is enabled, the Hard ROI X offset is automatically adjusted to centralize the ROI with respect to the camera whenever the ROI size is changed. This configuration is not aware of the rotation setting, which is applied by the IOC and not by the camera. Make sure to check the transformation setting (\emph{TransformType-Sts}). Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:hard-roi-auto-center-x}{AOIAutoCenterX-Sel/Sts}.
            \item \textbf{Hard ROI Auto Center Y}: When auto center Y is enabled, the Hard ROI Y offset is automatically adjusted to centralize the ROI with respect to the camera whenever the ROI size is changed. This configuration is not aware of the rotation setting, which is applied by the IOC and not by the camera. Make sure to check the transformation setting (\emph{TransformType-Sts}). Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:hard-roi-auto-center-y}{AOIAutoCenterY-Sel/Sts}.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{NDStats Centroid Center X}: Image centroid X as calculated by the NDStats plugin. NDStats calculates the centroid using image moments, and does so automatically anytime a new image is received from the camera. Enabling \hyperref[seq:fast-acq]{Fast Acquisition} disables centroid calculation. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:center-x-ndstats}{CenterXNDStats-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{NDStats Centroid Center Y}: Image centroid Y as calculated by the NDStats plugin. NDStats calculates the centroid using image moments, and does so automatically anytime a new image is received from the camera. Enabling \hyperref[seq:fast-acq]{Fast Acquisition} disables centroid calculation. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:center-y-ndstats}{CenterYNDStats-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{NDStats Centroid Sigma X}: Image centroid sigma X as calculated by the NDStats plugin. NDStats calculates the centroid using image moments, and does so automatically anytime a new image is received from the camera. Enabling \hyperref[seq:fast-acq]{Fast Acquisition} disables centroid calculation. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:sigma-x-ndstats}{SigmaXNDStats-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{NDStats Centroid Sigma Y}: Image centroid sigma Y as calculated by the NDStats plugin. NDStats calculates the centroid using image moments, and does so automatically anytime a new image is received from the camera. Enabling \hyperref[seq:fast-acq]{Fast Acquisition} disables centroid calculation. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:sigma-y-ndstats}{SigmaYNDStats-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{NDStats Centroid Theta}: Image centroid angle as calculated by the NDStats plugin. NDStats calculates the centroid using image moments, and does so automatically anytime a new image is received from the camera. Enabling \hyperref[seq:fast-acq]{Fast Acquisition} disables centroid calculation. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:theta-ndstats}{ThetaNDStats-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{DimFei Centroid Center X}: Image centroid X as calculated by the DimFei plugin. DimFei calculates the centroid using double gaussian fit, and does so automatically anytime a new image is received from the camera. Enabling \hyperref[seq:fast-acq]{Fast Acquisition} disables centroid calculation. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:center-x-dimfei}{CenterXDimFei-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{DimFei Centroid Center Y}: Image centroid Y as calculated by the DimFei plugin.

    \subsection{Network and Readout Settings}\label{sec:network-and-readout}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Readout Time} The readout time is the period the camera takes to read the pixel values after the exposure period is finished. The sensor readout time is the sum of each sensor line readout time and therefore depends on the AOI height. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:readout-time}{ReadoutTime-Mon}.

            \item \textbf{Data Max Throughput} Indicates the maximum amount of data that the camera could generate given no network restrictions or packet resends.

If software or hardware triggering is being used, the max frame rate allowed with the current camera settings will be used to calculate the max throughput. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:max-throughput}{MaxThroughput-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{Data Current Throughput} Indicates the bandwidth that the camera will need to transmit the image data given the current area of interest and pixel format, without considering bandwidth reserved for retries and needed for overhead, such as leaders and trailers. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:current-throughput}{CurrentThroughput-Mon}.
            \item \textbf{Packet Size} This parameter sets the size of packets used to transmit the data payload. The packet payload is equal to packet size minus 36 bytes from leader and trailer.

            \item \textbf{Inter-packet Delay} This parameter sets the delay, in ticks of 8 ns, between packets. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:inter-packet-delay}{InterPacketDelay-SP/RB}.
            \item \textbf{Transmission Delay} This parameter sets the delay, in ticks of 8 ns, between the time that the camera is ready to transmit a frame and when it actually begins to transmit it. Corresponding PV: \hyperlink{pv:transm-delay}{TransmDelay-SP/RB}.

            \item \textbf{Bandwidth Reserve Accumulation} After an unusual problem that interrupts image transmission, such as an EMI burst, the camera can use a larger than normal number of resends to transmit the complete image. This parameter is a multiplier to the \emph{Bandwidth Reserve} that limits the maximum number of resends that can be held in the accumulator pool.

                                                 with invalid values.
